This release contains information on M2, which consists of M1, savings deposits, small-denomination time deposits, and balances in retail money market mutual funds. Since this is seasonally adjusted, M2 is computed by summing the latter three factors up, which are seasonally adjusted individually, which will then be added to a seasonally adjusted M1. M2 is held mainly by households.
